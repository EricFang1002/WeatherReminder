# WeatherReminder – Django Web Development Project

Nov. 2016 – Dec. 2016

This project aims to provide a service for reminding users of recent weather and temperature changes. Users can add reminders based on their zip code and reminding types and receive notification emails whenever the reminders are triggered.
* Utilized Django framework, Python and MySQL database as the back-end and Bootstrap in the front-end to fetch weather and temperature information from Yahoo Weather API and send notification emails on weather changes using MVC architecture.
* Implemented several functionalities such as user registration, email verification, user login and email notification. • Designed a reminding algorithm based on the aggregation of reminders by zip code and users.
